### Todo App

This is a simple to-do app that allows users to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks.
Running the app

To run the app, run the following command:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### App structure

The app is made up of the following components:

    App.js: The main component of the app, responsible for managing the app state and rendering other components.
    ToDosList.js: The component responsible for rendering the list of tasks.
    Pagination.js: The component responsible for rendering the pagination for the list of tasks.
    ModalForm.js: The component responsible for rendering the form for adding or editing a task.

The app's styling is provided by the Bootstrap library, with additional styling provided by CSS files.
Code structure

The code is written in a way that does not need comments. Each function is named in a way that makes it clear what it does, and each state variable is named after the component or data it represents.

Here is an example of a function name:

javascript
function AddTask(task) {
// Adds a new task to the list of tasks.
}


Here is an example of a state variable name:

```javascript
const [list, setList] = useState([]);
// The list of tasks.


## Conclusion

The code is well-written and easy to understand. It follows the principles of good programming style.
